This is a simplistic launcher for Skyrim that is designed to automatically
open, monitor, and close Mod Organizer, Mantella, and xVASynth.

I created this application after getting tired of opening and
closing each of these programs individually.

Before using this launcher, you must specify the path to each program
within the provided Config.xml file.

To do this, open the Config.xml file and change the paths.

******EXAMPLE*******
<Program>C:\Path\To\Program.exe</Program>

After setting the path for each program, save the Config.xml file.

*****IMPORTANT****** 
Make sure the Config.xml and .exe files are in the same folder!

You can now run the launcher.

Create a shortcut for it and enjoy!

P.S. To close everything, just close Mod Organizer.
(The launcher will do the rest.)
